# Basic Pascal Compiler
This project aims to build a compiler for a language close to pascal, but with fewer features using lex and yacc. The compilation is broken into 5 stages, and separated into 2 SUBMISSION folders.
- SUBMISSION 1
    - TASK 1 - Lexical Analysis
    - TASK 2 - Syntax Analysis
- SUBMISSION 2
    - TASK 3 - Semantic Analysis
    - TASK 4 - Three Address Code Generation
    - TASK 5 - Compilation result and Run
Language Specification and Task description is present in 'Assignment-2.pdf'.
Details for running the individual tasks are present in the README files of individual SUBMISSION folders. This project can be run on Linux systems.
